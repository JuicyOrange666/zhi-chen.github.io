            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I am Zhi Chen, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Singapore Management University (SMU), focusing on Software Engineering. My research area includes exploring the promise and peril of collaborative code generation models, particularly how to balance effectiveness and memorization in such models. My work aims to contribute to the field of automated software engineering, with a specific focus on secure software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Master of Science in Computing from SMU with a GPA of 3.80/4, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from Hefei University of Technology, where I graduated with a grade of 85.07/100, ranking 28th out of 144 students. During my undergraduate studies, I also spent a semester as an exchange student at the National Yunlin University of Science & Technology in Taiwan.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have professional experience as a Backend Software Engineer at Sea Limited and Shanghai Baosight Software Co., Ltd., where I developed various backend systems, including an internal survey product and a blockchain-based supply chain finance system. My technical skills include expertise in Java, Golang, Python, Solidity, and various backend and frontend frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have been recognized with several awards, including the SMU Research Scholarship and the Golden Prize in the Fifth Internet Innovation Competition at Hefei University of Technology.
